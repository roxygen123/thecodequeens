    <h1> Let us introduce you the web developers behind the Codequeens</h1>
    We are three Code First: Girls alumni, each with very different lives, but one shared passion: coding!<br>
    We love to create websites and help you build a platform that's perfect for your blog, webshop, or whatever you want.

    <h2>Charlotte</h2>
    My name is Charlotte. I am from the Netherlands but I have lived in various places in the world, and am currently residing in London.<br>
    I like to cook and try out new recipes, but also love to go out for dinner with friends and enjoy good wines or craft beers.<br> </br>
    I look forward to working together with you on a website!
